# Connect4


Made by Scott Robinson. 

The game requires the ncurses library. 

The game supports singleplayer and multiplayer mode, which are selected from a menu screen. 
The game prompts the user for board size before beginning the game. 
Multiple games can be played in a row and the score is kept. 

The game checks for winning board states and determines the next best move using a graph of verticies. 
each vertex points to a node which stores a color and pointers to adjacent nodes. 
The game uses adjacent node pointers to traverse the graph and check for a win or determine the next best move.
